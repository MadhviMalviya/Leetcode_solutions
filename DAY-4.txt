*JAVASCRIPT*

1.DOM-Document Object Model

i. Representation of a web page as a document.
ii.Dom views an HTML document as a tree of nodes,<html> is viewed as Root node while <body> and <head> as child element.

2.Manipulation of DOM by using JS:

There are three ways to manipulate DOM by using JS:
I. BY ID
II.BY CLASS
III.BY TAGNAME

3.JS , HTML,CSS :

HTML,CSS tell the browser how to display the page , while JS allow user interaction and change the things as per user interaction.

JS:
i. Js code is placed in head section.
ii.Js runs in browser and can be disabled.
iii. JS is object oriented. 

4.Oject:

*Non-Primitive Datatype.
*Allows us to store multiple attributes having values.

"DOM:is a medium to enable browser to perform some actions."

"DOM : concept of DOM is for enable user interaction." 

"DOM: Allows us to change the elements in our website."

5.SCRIPT:

<script> can be write anywhere in the page but the best practice is to write it in the <head>.

6.Boileplate

A template we add at the start of our project.Template is repeated in multiple places with little and no variations.

 // document.write methods using writes directly to an open html document stream.
 // if we have to refer DOM then use 'document'
 // to refer/call chrome then use window keyword

   
To print:
 document.write('Hey!');
 console.log("everyone") //to print in browser console.
        
       
7. Alert box pop-up:window.alert("This is Alert pop-up.");

8.To Add space: document.write("hey<br>") // for inserting space.

9.Add two numbers: document.write(8 + 2);

10.getlementbyId:use to fetxh data from html element by using its id.

11.innerHTML:allows to write data in any html element,it is often used with getElementByiD.

12.link JS file by "< Script src="URL"> < / script > "

13.Comment:"ctrl+/" single line// or by double line /*

14.Concatenation:Appending one or more strings to the end of another string.

15.Console:Command line interface in browser , allows us to test or experiment with code.

   Containers for storing data values.
   WE can define variable by using var,let,const.

17.Rules & Regulations for naming the variable:

 1.Variable name contain letters,numbers and ($) symbol.
 2.NAME WILL aLWAYS begin with letters and not with numbers. 
 3.Case sensitive .
 4.Not to use reserved keywords i.e., let,var,document,console,log etc.
