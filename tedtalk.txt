TED-TALK 
There was no point in choosing a different topic than the Cosmos as I’m a big space enthusiast. 
I was inspired by Tom Holt’s Ted talk, an American journalist who has worked in New York Times magazine as a science author. 

The Ted talk discusses “Why do we explore space” ?

Being an Astrophile, I can relate it to myself as I’ve been asked the same question on  multiple occasions. 
While elaborating the ques that why we need to explore space? Holt further asked that why are we investing time, money, energy & resources in space exploration when we can use them in our own welfare, welfare of the Earth? 

Answering the question, he said “we explore because we are descendants of the people who explored as a result we are here in this position that we are discovering, inventing, celebrating,flying, living our life better than other species on the earth.” 

Tom said that the other aspect to this is the thought about the time when sun will turned into a red giant. 
How will be save ourselves from extinction? 
We have to explore in space to find another place to live.
 People say save planet Earth because there’s no planet B.
Here he wanted to say that If there is no planet B then we have to create it. 

Concluding the talk, Tom said that we have to seek for exo-planets where we can establish our existence just as we did after Pangea divided into many parts. We explored places to live and settled. 
“That’s why we need to explore.”

“And the biggest thing is, we can’t live without exploring because once you’ve tasted the taste of sky you’ll always look up and seek to explore more and more about it.”
